Sublime Text 3 Configuration
=====================

My Sublime Text 3 settings, keymaps, and installed packages.

###Installation
Clone the repo and create a symlink to the cloned directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:mlex121/sublime-text-settings.git

# May need to delete folder first. MAKE A BACKUP!
ln -s sublime-text-settings $SUBLIME_ROOT
```

Replace `$SUBLIME_ROOT` with the root directory of your Sublime Text 2/3 installation. On my OS X installation, for example, this is `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`.
